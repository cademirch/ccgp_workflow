# if using the BAM -> VCF workflows
bamsForGatk: "fastq2bam/01_mappedReads/" # directory containing BAMs for GATK. If you used the fastq -> bam workflow above, simply keep the default value; must be followed by a "/"
bamsForFB: "fastq2bam/01_mappedReads/"   # directory containing BAMs for Freebayes. If you used the fastq -> bam workflow above, simply keep the default value; must be followed by a "/"
bam_suffix: "_final.bam"                 # the suffix for your BAM files that follow all the sample names. If you use the fastq->BAM workflow above, simply keep the default value 

# Only used when split_by_n is True
minNmer: 500                # the minimum Nmer used to split up the genome; e.g. a value of 200 means only Nmers 200 or greater are used to define the boundaries of intervals. The minimum is 50.
maxIntervalLen: 20000000    # the desired maximum size of an interval for calling variants; more than 2Mb is a good starting point
maxBpPerList: 20000000      # the desired maximum number of bp per list file for GATK4; list files potentially contain many small intervals, and we cap the fraction of the genome contained in each list file here
maxIntervalsPerList: 200    # the desired maximum number of intervals per list file for GATK4; this prevents list files from containing thousands of small intervals, which can slow parts of GATK4. Default is good.
missingBpTolerance: 0       # the number of bp allowed to be missing from the interval list; increase if needed to solve issues with interval creation

## Coverage options ##
## default pipeline is optimized for low coverage data - if using high coverage data (> 10x), uncomment high coverage options and comment out low coverage options

# low coverage options (< 10x) 
minP: 1
minD: 1

# high coverage options (> 10x)
#minP: 2
#minD: 4

het_prior: 0.005    #prior probabilty of heterozygous site; changes likelihood of a site being called non-ref, but not genotype likelihoods

## callable sites bed file thresholds ##
########################################

mappability_min: 1    #regions of the genome with mappability less than this will be removed from callable sites bed file
cov_threshold: 2      #regions of the genome with coverage above/below cov_thresh standard deviations will be filtered

#this ignores small regions of abberatant coverage/mappability as often these are just below the threshold
#to do strict filtering, set to 0

callable_merge: 100   #merge callable regions separated by this or fewer bp into a single region
